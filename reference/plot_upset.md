# Build an upset plot from a named list of sets

Build an upset plot from a named list of sets

## Usage

``` r
plot_upset(
  list_input,
  xlab = "Combination",
  ylab = "Count",
  title = "",
  n_intersections = 10,
  ymax_offset = 0.5,
  order_by = c("freq", "degree"),
  backend = c("UpSetR", "ggupset"),
  text_scale = 1.5
)
```

## Arguments

- list_input:

  A named list where each element is a vector of items in that set

- xlab:

  X axis label for the intersection bar plot

- ylab:

  Y axis label for the bar counts

- title:

  Plot title

- n_intersections:

  Number of intersections to show in the upset x-axis (passed to
  ggupset::scale_x_upset). Default: 20

- ymax_offset:

  Numeric offset added to the computed ymax to provide headroom above
  the tallest bar. Default: 0.5

- order_by:

  How to order intersections: "freq" or "degree". Default: "freq"

- backend:

  Which backend to use for plotting: 'UpSetR' or 'ggupset'

- text_scale:

  Numeric scaling factor for text size (only used if backend is
  'UpSetR')

## Value

A ggplot object

## Examples

``` r
list_input <- list(
  A = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13),
  B = c(1, 2, 4, 5, 10),
  C = c(1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)
)
plot_upset(list_input)
